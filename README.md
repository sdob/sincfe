# sinc-fe

This is the frontend for SINC.

## Requirements

1. [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) v.6 or later (we should probably stick with LTS verions at least)
1. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Getting started

Ensure you have a working version
of Node (v. 6 or later), NPM,
and Yarn.
Working in a virtualenv is strongly
recommended.

From the base directory, run

    $ yarn install

followed by

    $ yarn start

and then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in your
browser. You should see the SINC login page.
(If you are not also running `sincserver`,
then you won't be able to do anything here.
Consult the docs for [that project](https://github.com/sdob/sincserver) to
get it up and running.)
